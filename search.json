    "text": "Federal COVID-19 pandemic-response packages have provided unprecedented aid to state and local governments, including $800 billion that can be used flexibly to promote an inclusive recovery. These resources create an unparalleled opportunity for advocates and local decision-makers to ensure federal funds reach communities that need them most, close equity gaps exacerbated by the pandemic, and address the root causes of inequities. To take advantage of this opportunity, local leaders need timely data and evidence to ensure funds are used effectively and equitably.\nThis dashboard tracks the federal recovery funds flowing into the City of Rochester and Monroe County that can be used for inclusive recovery efforts. The dashboard primarily tracks appropriations, or how much funding the federal government has committed to provide local jurisdictions. For a few select programs where information is available, the dashboard also explores spending by zip code."
