ARPA includes the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) program, which directed $350 billion of flexible funds to states, counties, tribal governments and localities.\nAppropriations: the amount of funding committed by the federal government to the city, county, or state for a given program.\nAssistance for Returning Residents/Justice Involved People: services aimed at assisting people returning from incarceration or who are involved in the criminal justice system.\nAssistance for Specific Populations: targeted programs for specific populations, such as older adults, veterans, people with disabilities, or people experiencing homelessness.\nAwards: financial assistance that provides support or stimulation to accomplish a public purpose.

Financing of this type is determined by the merits of the application and is not predetermined.\nConsolidated Appropriations Act 2021: A $2.3 trillion spending bill passed on December 21, 2020, that includes the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA), which provided additional stimulus relief for the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES): a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill addressing economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic passed on March 27, 2020.

    "text": "In response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government provided unprecedented levels of flexible relief funds to local governments across the country, including Rochester . These federal recovery funds offer an unparalleled opportunity to not only stimulate economic recovery from the pandemic, but to also increase equity. To do so, the funds must be used to ensure that everyone, especially historically excluded groups, can benefit from and contribute to economic recovery. Research has demonstrated that cities can recover from economic distress while improving on inclusion and equity. However, this is not a given. Many cities lose ground on either racial or economic inclusion during a recovery by allowing funds to flow to business as usual.\nTo increase transparency in this process, this dashboard shares data on how the City of Rochester and Monroe County allocated and spent a portion of the flexible recovery funds. The dashboard focuses on State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) provided through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) because they were one of the most flexible funding sources, giving local governments authority to decide how they should be spent. And, they tended to be spent more on longer term recovery efforts than on short term emergency public health response, which was the focus of CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) dollars. SLFRF must be obligated by the end of 2024 and spent by the end of 2026.\nThe dashboard starts by showing what percent of the allocations align with the building blocks of an inclusive recovery, which are five strategies for spending that direct funds to support equity and inclusion. As of 2023/08/22 date, 61% of the dollars in the City of Rochester and Monroe County were allocated toward programs and initiatives that align with these building blocks. The dashboard then shows more broadly how funds are being spent by policy area and subtopic. Next, it explores how well the allocations align with Rochester Area Community Foundation’s priorities. Finally, it shows how the City of Rochester’s SLFRF capital investments map onto racial characteristics of neighborhoods within the region, as well as how they overlap with the original redlining maps for the city. (Redlining refers to the process in which borrowers are denied access to credit due to the racial composition of their neighborhood.) Finally, at the end of the dashboard is a table. showing all of the allocations and their descriptions in detail.\nNote that this dashboard does not track outcomes from these investments – it only shows where the dollars are flowing. Simply allocating funds toward topics that could increase equity and inclusion does not guarantee that they do so. Future research efforts should closely monitor outcomes and impacts from the recovery dollar investments to ensure that they close equity gaps exacerbated by the pandemic and address the root causes of inequities."

These building blocks were created in collaboration with community stakeholders across the country and include:\n\nCreate jobs for residents hardest hit by the pandemic or who face the greatest barriers to employment\nConnect residents to jobs and economic opportunities, including through workforce development, child care, transportation, or broadband\nReinvest in disinvested communities and address long-standing disparities in access to education, capital, economic opportunities, and climate resilience\nStabilize housing and expand affordable housing options for low-income households and housing-insecure renters\nCreate opportunities for low-wealth households to build wealth.\n\nAcross all allocations in the Rochester region, 55% of the funding has been allocated towards these strategies that promote inclusive recovery and equitable growth. The figure below shows the total amount of funding for Rochester and Monroe County that was allocated to programs that align with these building blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Urban Institute calculations of data from City of Rochester ARPA Reporting Dashboard and Monroe County Recovery Plan 2023 Annual Report"

    "text": "Which neighborhoods are the funds being spent in?\nThe map below shows how the City of Rochester’s SLFRF capital investments map onto racial characteristics of neighborhoods, as well as the original Federal redlining maps for the city. Click on the tabs at the top to see how they overlap with the percent of residents who are Black in a neighborhood and the percent of residents who are Latine in a neighborhood.\nRedlining refers to the system that the Federal Housing Administration and the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation used to grade the profitability of neighborhoods in the late 1930s. The four categories were green (“best”), blue (“still desirable”), yellow (“definitely declining”), and red (“hazardous”). These grades were largely based on the neighborhood’s racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and religious composition. Generally, White, middle-class neighborhoods received FHA home loans, whereas many Black and Latine neighborhoods were deemed hazardous and declining in value and did not receive FHA insured mortgages or loans. These maps had long lasting effects on racial segregation, homeownership, and house values in redlined neighborhoods.\nTo increase equity in the region, leaders must overinvest in communities that have been underinvested in historically. These investments must be those that benefit incumbent residents, meaning that they should not be investments that only benefit new, incoming wealthier residents, or those that have negative impacts on immediate neighbors, like a sewage treatment facility or a highway that pollutes the air. And, they must be investments that community members want, particularly historically excluded members. The maps below give us a first approximation of how equitably investments are distributed, but further exploration of how these investments align with the goals of community members and how much they benefit historically excluded residents is necessary to ensure that they are increasing equity within those communities.\n\nRedliningPercent BlackPercent Latine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This dashboard uses the term “Latine” because some consider it a more inclusive term than “Hispanic,” because it includes people from all countries in Latin America, and than “Latino/a” because it is a gender neutral term. Percentages shown in this map were based on American Community Survey data for “Hispanic or Latino” population."
