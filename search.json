The federal government has transferred unprecedented levels of flexible relief funds to local governments to help them recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and to move into longer-term growth. These funds grant a great deal of authority to municipal governments to decide how they should be spent, and they must be obligated by the end of 2024 and spent by the end of 2026. As the City of Rochester and Monroe County allocate and spend these funds, they have an opportunity to not only stimulate economic growth, but to increase equity and remediate some of the past injustices that have been built into our nation’s laws and programs. To do so, the funds must be used to ensure that everyone–especially historically excluded groups–can benefit from and contribute to economic growth.\nPrevious work by the Urban Institute identified five building blocks of an inclusive recovery and equitable economy, shown below. These were identified based on empirical research and in collaboration with community leaders from across the country. We focus on how well Rochester and Monroe County’s SLFRF allocations align with the building blocks of an inclusive recovery and equitable economy.\nThe Building Blocks of An Inclusive Recovery and Equitable Economy\nThe dashboard is laid out as follows:\nNote: This dashboard does not track outcomes from these investments – it only shows where the dollars are flowing1."

For example, Gabrielle Smith, seen in the video below, received funding through the City of Rochester’s Guaranteed Basic Income pilot which fits into the social services policy area under cash assistance. This means that she received $500 each month over 12 months. This helped her work toward her goals of buying a car so that she can help take her brand-new granddaughter to the places she needs to go, and to have more time to spend with her family without stressing about financial issues. Watch the short film below to hear stories of how these funds have affected people in Rochester."

    "text": "How much is allocated toward an inclusive recovery and equitable economy?\n\nBy our estimation, 66% of city and county SLFRF funding has been allocated towards the building blocks of an inclusive recovery and equitable economy. The figure below shows the total amount of funding for Rochester and Monroe County that was allocated to programs that align with these building blocks, based on review of the program description and goals.\n\n\n\n\nSource: Urban Institute calculations of data from City of Rochester ARPA Reporting Dashboard and Monroe County Recovery Plan 2023 Annual Report\n\n\n\nOut of the 66% of funds allocated to programs that align with the five building blocks of an inclusive recovery and equitable economy, the most funding has been allocated to reinvesting in disinvested communities while the least has been allocated to creating jobs for residents hardest hit by the pandemic or who face the greatest barriers to employment. The figure below shows how that funding is divided among the five building blocks and includes only the funds allocated to programs that align with the building blocks (the 66%). \n\n\n\n\nSource: Urban Institute calculations of data from City of Rochester ARPA Reporting Dashboard and Monroe County Recovery Plan 2023 Annual Report\n\n\n\nHow are other places spending their recovery dollars to increase equity?\nDayton, Ohio used a comprehensive community engagement process, including an online survey and series of public meetings, to inform its focus areas for ARPA spending. One of the areas identified was supporting Black- and Brown-owned businesses. This is one strategy that can contribute to building wealth for people of color and help to close the racial wealth gap. To begin, the city undertook a comprehensive review of the local business ecosystem to identify gaps in support. Based on this analysis, they created an Inclusive Business Recovery Opportunity Center to support the development, growth, and expansion of local businesses through coordination of services and capacity building. The city is also supporting Black- and Brown-owned businesses through a Micro-Grant Fund, a Racial Equity Fund, and Small Business Assistance. The city has allocated $7.7 million to these projects.\nOne business supported by this funding is 6888 Kitchen Incubator (pronounced 6 triple 8), a commercial kitchen aiming to cultivate and support food entrepreneurs through business curriculum development, advanced mentoring, facilitation of business support, and a certified kitchen space for food preparation. Dayton’s ARPA [CS1] funding supported 6888 Kitchen in capital equipment purchases to create the commercial kitchen space. The incubator opened in spring 2024 with eight food enterprises already on board. Dayton’s support of this woman, minority, veteran-owned business will in turn continue to support other local business efforts.\n\n“Recognizing that there had been inequities in policies long ago and that the inequities from those unjust policies were still continuing to affect communities… This would be an opportunity to change those frameworks, right a little bit of those wrongs, and put people on a pathway moving forward.” \n- LaShea Lofton, Deputy City Manager"

These include:\n\n\nClosing the academic achievement and opportunity gap; \nFostering racial and ethnic understanding and equity; \nPartnering against poverty; \nSupporting arts and culture; \nPreserving historic assets; \nAdvancing environmental justice and sustainability; and  \nPromoting successful aging.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Urban Institute calculations of data from City of Rochester ARPA Reporting Dashboard and Monroe County Recovery Plan 2023 Annual Report\n\n\n\nThe figure below shows how SLFRF funding is divided among the priority topics and includes only the funds allocated to programs that align with one of RACF’s priority areas. The majority of the aligned funds are for partnering against poverty, followed by advancing environmental justice. Less well funded through SLFRF are preserving historical assets, promoting successful aging, and supporting arts and culture.\n\n\n\n\nSource: Urban Institute calculations of data from City of Rochester ARPA Reporting Dashboard and Monroe County Recovery Plan 2023 Annual Report\n\n\n\nAn Example: Rochester Energy Efficiency and Weatherization\n\n\n\n\nMonroe County used 67% of their SLFRF funds to competitively fund community organizations and County departments that align with six focus areas: public safety, public health and wellness, economic recovery, workforce development, infrastructure improvements, and sustainability. One of the groups that received this funding is Rochester Energy Efficiency and Weatherization (RENEW), a collective impact initiative in Rochester that helps income-qualified homeowners make their homes more energy-efficient, healthier, and safer from environmental hazards. RENEW received $850,000 of SLFRF funds from Monroe County to fund its grants for repairs or replacements in community members’ homes, including work on insulation, furnaces, hot water heaters, and emergency health and safety repairs of sewer lines and electrical panels. Using these funds, RENEW will assist up to 200 income-qualified homeowners and up to 800 residents living in those homes to complete projects that promote energy-efficiency, health, and/or safety goals. Listen to an episode of NPR’s Connections to hear about RENEW’s impact in the community.\n\nWe’re hearing about the better physical and mental health impacts, particularly the benefit of the mental health impacts in terms of being able to have a home that is safe and healthy, and that you’re not worried about the leak in the basement or the fact that your utility bill is too difficult to pay.\n- Elizabeth McDade, RENEW Director"

    "text": "Which neighborhoods are the funds allocated to?\nThe map below shows how the City of Rochester’s SLFRF capital investments map onto original Federal redlining maps, as well as racial characteristics of neighborhoods. Click on the tabs at the top to see how they overlap with the percent of residents who are Black in a neighborhood and the percent of residents who are Hispanic/Latino 2 in a neighborhood.\nRedlining refers to the system that the Federal Housing Administration and the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation used to grade the profitability of neighborhoods in the late 1930s. The four categories were green (areas most desirable for lending purposes), blue (still desirable), yellow (declining), and red (the riskiest for mortgage support). These grades were largely based on the neighborhood’s racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and religious composition. Generally, white, middle-class neighborhoods received FHA home loans, whereas many Black and Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods were deemed hazardous and declining in value and did not receive FHA insured mortgages or loans. These maps had long lasting effects on racial segregation, homeownership, and house values in redlined neighborhoods.\nThe maps below give us a first approximation of how equitably investments are distributed. We encourage further exploration of how these investments align with the goals of community members and how much they benefit historically excluded residents.\n\n\nRedlining\nPercent Black\nPercent Hispanic/Latino\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow might Rochester invest more into equity and inclusion?\nOther places have found ways to use federal funds to invest in stabilizing housing, building wealth, and creating jobs—the building blocks of an inclusive recovery and equitable economy. For instance, the City of Boston is using ARPA funds to transform publicly-owned land into green, mixed income communities. One project in Chinatown, shown below, will include 83 affordable rental units and 36 affordable homeownership units. The property is located in a walkable and bikeable neighborhood and will be energy efficient and follow the City of Boston’s Carbon Free, Climate Resilient, and Healthy Community goals. It was developed after extensive community engagement with nearby neighbors. To read more about this and other investments into the building blocks of an inclusive recovery and equitable economy, see this research summary from the Urban Institute that highlights one example from each building block."
