    "text": "Glossary\n\nLast Updated: 2024-04-24\n\n\nThis glossary provides the definition of key terms as used in the Dashboard.\nAffordable Housing: investments aimed at preserving or creating affordable housing units.\nAlternative Emergency Response: services such as sobering centers, behavior health programs, and implementation of the 211 call line, a referral line for human and social services.\nAirports: defined in the law as any area of land or water used or intended for landing or takeoff of aircraft including appurtenant area used or intended for airport buildings, facilities, as well as rights of way together with the buildings and facilities.\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act (ARPA): a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill addressing economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic passed on March 11, 2021. ARPA includes the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) program, which directed $350 billion of flexible funds to states, counties, tribal governments and localities.\nAppropriations: the amount of funding committed by the federal government to the city, county, or state for a given program.\nAssistance for Returning Residents/Justice Involved People: services aimed at assisting people returning from incarceration or who are involved in the criminal justice system.\nAssistance for Specific Populations: targeted programs for specific populations, such as older adults, veterans, people with disabilities, or people experiencing homelessness.\nAwards: financial assistance that provides support or stimulation to accomplish a public purpose.

Financing of this type is determined by the merits of the application and is not predetermined.\nConsolidated Appropriations Act 2021: A $2.3 trillion spending bill passed on December 21, 2020, that includes the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA), which provided additional stimulus relief for the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES): a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill addressing economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic passed on March 27, 2020.

Expiration dates vary by program.\nFormula Grant: Unlike a competitive grant, formula grants are awarded to recipients who are predetermined, and the term “formula” refers to the way the grant funding is allocated to recipients. Formula grants are non-competitive. Legislation and regulations set the formula for this type of funding, so funders must adhere to that formula when awarding grants.

As the City of Rochester and Monroe County allocate and spend these federal funds, they have an opportunity to not only stimulate economic growth, but to increase equity and remediate some of the past injustices that have been built into our nation’s laws and programs. To do so, the funds must be used to ensure that everyone–especially historically excluded groups–can benefit from and contribute to economic growth.\nThis dashboard tracks data on how the City of Rochester and Monroe County have allocated State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) provided through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). These funds grant a great deal of authority to municipal governments to decide how they should be spent, and they must be obligated by the end of 2024 and spent by the end of 2026. We focus on how well these allocations align with the building blocks of an inclusive recovery and equitable economy.\nThe dashboard is laid out as follows:\nNote: This dashboard does not track outcomes from these investments – it only shows where the dollars are flowing.\nFigure 4\nThe figure below shows how SLFRF funding is divided among the priority topics and includes only the funds allocated to programs that align with one of RACF’s priority areas. The majority of the aligned funds are for partnering against poverty, followed by advancing environmental justice. Less well funded through SLFRF are preserving historical assets, promoting successful aging, and supporting arts and culture.\nFigure 5: Source: Urban Institute calculations of data from City of Rochester ARPA Reporting Dashboard and Monroe County Recovery Plan 2023 Annual Report"

For example, Gabrielle Smith, seen below, received funding through the City of Rochester’s Guaranteed Basic Income pilot. This means that she received $500 each month over 12 months. This helped her work toward her goals of buying a car so that she can help take her brand-new granddaughter to the places she needs to go, and to have more time to spend with her family without stressing about financial issues. Watch this short film to hear stories of how these funds have affected people in Rochester."

    "text": "How much is being spent on an inclusive recovery and equitable economy?\nBy our estimation, 66% of city and county funding has been allocated towards the building blocks of an inclusive recovery and equitable economy. Previous work by the Urban Institute identified five building blocks of an inclusive recovery and equitable economy, shown below. These were identified based on empirical research and in collaboration with community leaders from across the country.\nThe Building Blocks of An Inclusive Recovery and Equitable Growth\n\n\nSource: Adapted from Poethig et al 2018 in collaboration with community stakeholders across the country\n\nFigure 2 below shows the total amount of funding for Rochester and Monroe County that was allocated to programs that align with these building blocks, based on review of the program description and goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Source: Urban Institute calculations of data from City of Rochester ARPA Reporting Dashboard and Monroe County Recovery Plan 2023 Annual Report\n\n\n\n\nOut of the 65% of funds allocated to programs that align with the five building blocks of an inclusive recovery, the most funding has been allocated to reinvesting in disinvested communities while the least has been allocated to creating jobs for residents hardest hit by the pandemic or who face the greatest barriers to employment. Figure 3 below shows how that funding is divided among the five building blocks and includes only the funds allocated to programs that align with the building blocks (the 65%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Source: Urban Institute calculations of data from City of Rochester ARPA Reporting Dashboard and Monroe County Recovery Plan 2023 Annual Report\n\n\n\n\nHow are other places spending their recovery dollars to increase equity?\n[Placeholder for Example from a Peer City]"

    "text": "Which neighborhoods are the funds being spent in?\nThe map below shows how the City of Rochester’s SLFRF capital investments map onto racial characteristics of neighborhoods, as well as the original Federal redlining maps for the city. Click on the tabs at the top to see how they overlap with the percent of residents who are Black in a neighborhood and the percent of residents who are Hispanic/Latino in a neighborhood.\nRedlining refers to the system that the Federal Housing Administration and the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation used to grade the profitability of neighborhoods in the late 1930s. The four categories were green (areas most desirable for lending purposes), blue (still desirable), yellow (declining), and red (the riskiest for mortgage support). These grades were largely based on the neighborhood’s racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and religious composition. Generally, White, middle-class neighborhoods received FHA home loans, whereas many Black and Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods were deemed hazardous and declining in value and did not receive FHA insured mortgages or loans. These maps had long lasting effects on racial segregation, homeownership, and house values in redlined neighborhoods. \n\n\nRedlining\nPercent Black\nPercent Hispanic/Latino\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow might Rochester invest more in some of these building blocks?\nOther places have found ways to use federal funds to invest in stabilizing housing, building wealth, and creating jobs. For instance, the City of Boston is using ARPA funds to transform publicly-owned land into green, mixed income communities. One project in Chinatown, shown below, will include 83 affordable rental units and 36 affordable homeownership units. The property is located in a walkable and bikeable neighborhood and will be energy efficient and follow the City of Boston’s Carbon Free, Climate Resilient, and Healthy Community goals. It was developed after extensive community engagement with nearby neighbors. \n\n\nSource: XYZ"
