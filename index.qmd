The federal government provided unprecedented levels of flexible relief funds to
local governments across the country, including those [in the Rochester
region](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/105119/harnessing-federal-funds-for-inclusive-recovery-in-rochester-ny_0.pdf),
to help them recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the
City of Rochester and Monroe County continue to allocate and spend these federal
recovery funds, they have an unparalleled opportunity to not only stimulate
economic recovery, but to increase equity and remediate some of the past
inequities that have been [built into our nation’s laws and
programs](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SdtDDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT4&dq=color+of+law&ots=RL_u4QqRBH&sig=eYYnHvwibwB_XBfpzr0jQVK2SOs#v=onepage&q=color%20of%20law&f=false).
To do so, the funds [must be
used](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/inclusive-recovery-us-cities)
to ensure that everyone--especially historically excluded groups--can benefit
from and contribute to economic growth.


To increase transparency in this process, this dashboard tracks data on how the
City of Rochester and Monroe County have allocated and spent [State and Local
Fiscal Recovery Funds
(SLFRF)](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/state-and-local-fiscal-recovery-funds#:~:text=The%20Coronavirus%20State%20and%20Local,COVID%2D19%20public%20health%20emergency)
provided through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). SLFRF must be obligated by
the end of 2024 and spent by the end of 2026. The dashboard focuses on SLFRF
because of their flexibility in giving local governments authority to decide how
they should be spent. And, we focus on how well these allocations align with the
building blocks of an inclusive recovery and equitable growth, shown below.


**The Building Blocks of An Inclusive Recovery and Equitable Growth**

[![Source: Adapted from Poethig et al 2018 in collaboration with community
stakeholders across the
country](www/images/building-blocks.png){fig-align="center"}](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/inclusive-recovery-us-cities)

The dashboard is laid out as follows:

-   Alignment of allocations with the building blocks of an inclusive recovery,
    shown above
-   How funds are being spent by policy area and subtopic
-   Alignment of allocations with Rochester Area Community Foundation’s
    priorities
-   Mapping of the City of Rochester’s SLFRF capital investments onto original
    redlining maps for the city and current racial characteristics of
    neighborhoods
-   Detailed table of all allocations and their descriptions

**Note: This dashboard does not track outcomes from these investments – it only
shows where the dollars are flowing.** Simply allocating funds toward topics
that could increase equity and inclusion does not guarantee that they do so.
Future research efforts should closely monitor outcomes and impacts from the
recovery dollar investments to ensure that they close equity gaps exacerbated by
the pandemic and address the root causes of inequities.

## How Much is Being Spent on an Inclusive Recovery?

[Previous work by the Urban
Institute](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/105290/aligning-the-use-of-recovery-funds-with-community-goals-in-rochester-new-york.pdf)
identified five building blocks of an inclusive recovery. These building blocks
were created in collaboration with community stakeholders across the country and
include:

1.  **Create jobs** for residents hardest hit by the pandemic or who face the
    greatest barriers to employment
2.  **Connect historically excluded residents to jobs and economic
    opportunities**, including through workforce development, child care,
    transportation, or broadband
3.  **Reinvest in disinvested communities** and address long-standing
    disparities in access to education, capital, economic opportunities, and
    climate resilience
4.  **Stabilize housing and expand affordable housing** options for low-income
    households and housing-insecure renters
5.  Create opportunities for low-wealth households to **build wealth**.

By our estimation, **`r building_blocks_pct`** of city and county funding has
been allocated towards the building blocks of an inclusive recovery and
equitable growth. The figure below shows the total amount of funding for
Rochester and Monroe County that was allocated to programs that align with these
building blocks, based on review of the program description and goals.

```{r}

## These Data in Action

These number have real effects on people’s lives. For example, [insert GI recipient’s name], seen below, received funding through the City of Rochester’s Guaranteed income pilot. This means that she received $X each month over [time period]. This helped her XYZ. 

![Source: XYZ](www/images/example-data-story.png)

Out of the 65% of funds allocated to programs that align with the five building
blocks of an inclusive recovery, the most funding has been allocated to
reinvesting in disinvested communities while the least has been allocated to
creating jobs for residents hardest hit by the pandemic or who face the greatest
barriers to employment. The figure below shows how that funding is divided among
the five building blocks and includes only the funds allocated to programs that
align with the building blocks (the 65%).

```{r}
#| fig-cap: !expr source

total_allocations <-
  data %>%
  summarise(total_allocation = sum(allocation, na.rm = TRUE), .by = "building_blocks") %>%
  arrange(desc(total_allocation))

    str_detect(building_blocks, pattern = "Create jobs") ~ "Create jobs",

  mutate(geography = factor(geography,
    levels = c("Monroe County", "Rochester")
  ))

  ggplot(aes(x = building_blocks, y = allocation, fill = geography)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::label_number(scale = 1 / 1e6, suffix = "M", prefix = "$"),
    limits = c(0, 100 * 1e6),
    breaks = seq(0, 100 * 1e6, by = 25 * 1e6)
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 20)) +

  scale_fill_manual(
    values = racf_palette,
    guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)
  ) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Total Allocation")
```

 
## How might Rochester invest more in some of these building blocks? 

Other places have found ways to use federal funds to invest in stabilizing housing, building wealth, and creating jobs. For instance, the City of Boston is using ARPA funds to transform publicly-owned land into green, mixed income communities. One project in Chinatown, shown below, will include 83 affordable rental units and 36 affordable homeownership units. The property is a short walk to two train stops and is located in a walkable and bikeable neighborhood. The project was developed after extensive community engagement with nearby neighbors and will also be energy efficient and follow the City of Boston’s Carbon Free, Climate Resilient, and Healthy Community goals.

## What policy areas are being funded?

The figure below shows how funding has been allocated across policy categories
and includes all allocations, not just those that align with the building blocks
of an inclusive recovery.

By category, most of the funds have been allocated to Community and Economic
Development, Infrastructure, and Housing, while the least have been allocated to
Operations, Public Health and COVID-19 Response, and Social Services.

## What subtopics are funded within each policy area?

The figure below provides a more detailed breakdown of allocations to each
policy area. Each policy area tab breaks down the allocations into subtopics.
For example, most of the money allocated to community and economic development
has gone to workforce development.

The Rochester Area Community Foundation's key priorities for investment in the
region include:

-   Closing the academic achievement and opportunity gap

-   Fostering racial and ethnic understanding and equity

-   Partnering against poverty

-   Supporting arts and culture

-   Preserving historic assets

-   Advancing environmental justice and sustainability

-   Promoting successful aging

Overall, **{.pct allocated_to_racf_pct}** of SLFRF funding has been allocated towards these priority areas.

The figure below shows how SLFRF funding is divided among the priority topics
and includes only the funds allocated to programs that align with one of RACF’s
priority areas. The majority of the aligned funds are for partnering against
poverty, followed by advancing environmental justice. Less well funded through
SLFRF are preserving historical assets, promoting successful aging, and
supporting arts and culture.

## Which neighborhoods are the funds being spent in?

The map below shows how the City of Rochester’s SLFRF capital investments map
onto racial characteristics of neighborhoods, as well as the original Federal
redlining maps for the city. **Click on the tabs at the top to see how they
overlap with the percent of residents who are Black in a neighborhood and the
percent of residents who are Hispanic/Latino in a neighborhood.**

[Redlining](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america)
refers to the system that the Federal Housing Administration and the Home
Owners’ Loan Corporation used to grade the profitability of neighborhoods in the
late 1930s. The four categories were green (areas most desirable for lending
purposes), blue (still desirable), yellow (declining), and red (the riskiest for
mortgage support). These grades were largely based on the neighborhood’s racial,
ethnic, socioeconomic, and religious composition. Generally, White, middle-class
neighborhoods received FHA home loans, whereas many Black and Hispanic/Latino
neighborhoods were deemed hazardous and declining in value and did not receive
FHA insured mortgages or loans. These maps [had long lasting
effects](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/200568/1/1010730592.pdf) on
racial segregation, homeownership, and house values in redlined neighborhoods.

__To increase equity in the region, leaders must focus investments in
communities that have been underinvested in historically.__ These investments
must be those that , meaning that they should not be investments that only
benefit new, incoming wealthier residents, or those that have negative impacts
on immediate neighbors, like a sewage treatment facility or a highway that
pollutes the air. And, they must be investments that , particularly historically
excluded members. The maps below give us a first approximation of how equitably
investments are distributed. We encourage further exploration of how these
investments align with the goals of community members and how much they benefit
historically excluded residents.

## Explore All Programs Funded {#programs-table}

This table shows all programs that the City of Rochester and Monroe County have
allocated SLFRF funds to, as well as their building block, policy area, policy
subtopic, and RACF priority area category. The default display on the table
shows the programs in order from largest to smallest allocation. You can use the
arrows next to each column title to sort the table by that column, and you can
use the search bars under each column or the overall search bar to search the
table.

## About the Dashboard

This dashboard was created by the [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/) in
partnership with and support from ACT Rochester and [Rochester Area Community
Foundation (RACF)](https://www.racf.org/) to visualize Monroe County and the
City of Rochester's ARPA spending by the five building blocks of inclusive
recovery, policy category, and RACF's investment priorities. By tracking
recovery funding expenditures, this dashboard allows us to monitor public
spending by the categories most critical in supporting an inclusive recovery
from the COVID-19 pandemic.
