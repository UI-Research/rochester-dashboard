Federal COVID-19 pandemic-response packages have provided unprecedented aid to state and local governments, including $800 billion that can be used flexibly to promote an inclusive recovery. These resources create an unparalleled opportunity for advocates and local decision-makers to ensure federal funds reach communities that need them most, close equity gaps exacerbated by the pandemic, and address the root causes of inequities. To take advantage of this opportunity, local leaders need timely data and evidence to ensure funds are used effectively and equitably. 
 
This dashboard tracks the federal recovery funds flowing into the City of Rochester and Monroe County through the American Rescue Plan State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds that can be used for inclusive recovery efforts. The dashboard tracks how the City and County have allocated these flexible recovery funds.

```{r}
ragg_png = function(..., res = 192) {
  ragg::agg_png(..., res = res, units = "in")
}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = "ragg_png", fig.ext = "png")
```

```{r setup}
librarian::shelf(tidyverse, here, urbnthemes, gt)
set_urbn_defaults(style = "print", base_size = 12)
racf_palette <- c("#D6A123", "#ED0A72", "#D442CF", "#696B4F", "#8FAEBE")

```

```{r load-data}

data <- 
  readxl::read_xlsx("data/data-raw/dashboard-data.xlsx") %>% 
  mutate(allocation = str_remove_all(allocation, '[,$]') %>% as.numeric()) %>% 
  mutate(racf_categories = str_to_title(racf_categories))
```

## Total Funding by Policy Area

```{r}
total <- summarise(data, total = sum(allocation, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% pull() 
total_fmt <- scales::label_number(scale = 1/1e6, suffix = 'M')(total)

total_spent <-  summarise(data, total_spent = sum(spent, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% pull() 
total_spent_fmt <-scales::label_number(scale = 1/1e6, suffix = 'M')(total_spent)
pct_spent <- total_spent / total
pct_spent_fmt <- scales::label_percent()(pct_spent)
```

```{r}
total_allocations <- data %>%
  summarise(total_allocation = sum(allocation, na.rm = TRUE), .by = 'topic') %>%
  arrange(desc(total_allocation))

top3 <-
  total_allocations %>% 
  slice_max(total_allocation, n = 3) %>% 
  pull(topic) %>% 
  str_flatten_comma(", and ")

bottom3 <-
  total_allocations %>% 
  slice_min(total_allocation, n = 3) %>% 
  pull(topic) %>% 
  str_flatten_comma(", and ")
```

Overall, `r total_fmt` of funds have been allocated to the city of Rochester and Monroe County, and `r pct_spent_fmt` have been reported as spent. By
category, **most** of the funds have been allocated to **`r top3`**, while the **least**
have been allocated to **`r bottom3`**:

## Explore Funding by Subtopic

By subtopic, most of the money allocated to community and economic development has gone to workforce development, while most of the money for infrastructure has been allocated to water projects:

## How Much is Being Spent on an Inclusive Recovery?

Broadly, there are [five building blocks](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/aligning-use-recovery-funds-community-goals-rochester-new-york) of an inclusive recovery:

1.  **Create jobs** for residents hardest hit by the pandemic or who face the
    greatest barriers to employment
2.  **Connect residents to jobs** and economic opportunities, including through
    workforce development, child care, transportation, or broadband
3.  **Reinvest in disinvested communities** and address long-standing disparities in
    access to education, capital, economic opportunities, and climate resilience
4.  **Stabilize housing and expand affordable housing** options for low-income
    households and housing-insecure renters
5.  Create opportunities for low-wealth households to **build wealth**.

```{r}
pct <-
  data %>% 
  filter(geography == "Rochester") %>% 
  group_by(is_building_block = is.na(building_blocks)) %>% 
  summarise(allocation = sum(allocation, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(total = sum(allocation),
         pct= allocation / total) %>% 
  filter(is_building_block == TRUE) %>% 
  pull(pct) %>% 
  scales::label_percent()(.)
```

In the Rochester region, **`r pct`** of the funding has been allocated towards these strategies that promote inclusive recovery and equitable growth, with most inclusive investments going toward reinvesting in disinvested communities, and least going to creating jobs for residents hardest hit by the pandemic or who face the greatest barriers to employment.

```{r}
total_allocations <-
  data %>% 
  summarise(total_allocation = sum(allocation, na.rm = TRUE), .by = "building_blocks") %>%

  mutate(building_blocks = if_else(str_detect(building_blocks, 'Create jobs'), 'Create jobs', building_blocks)) %>%

## Funding by Rochester Area Community Foundation Priorities

```{r}
pct <-
  data %>% 
  filter(geography == "Rochester") %>% 
  group_by(is_priority = is.na(racf_categories)) %>% 
  summarise(allocation = sum(allocation, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(total = sum(allocation),
         pct = allocation / total) %>% 
  filter(is_priority == TRUE) %>% 
  pull(pct) %>% 
  scales::label_percent()()
```


The Rochester Area Community Foundation's key priorities for investment in the
region include closing the academic achievement and opportunity gap, fostering
racial and ethnic understanding and equity, partnering against poverty,
supporting arts and culture, preserving historic assets, advancing environmental
justice and sustainability, and promoting successful aging. Overall, **`r pct`** of the
Federal funding has been allocated towards these priority areas:

```{r}
data %>% 
  summarise(allocation = sum(allocation, na.rm = TRUE), .by = c("racf_categories", "geography")) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(total_allocation = sum(allocation), .by = 'racf_categories') %>% 
  mutate(racf_categories = reorder(racf_categories, total_allocation)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = racf_categories, y = allocation, fill = geography)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number(scale = 1/1e6, suffix = 'M', prefix = '$')) +
  scale_fill_discrete(guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = racf_palette) +

## About the Dashboard

This dashboard was created by the [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/) in partnership with and support from [The Rochester Area Community Foundation (RACF)](https://www.racf.org/) to visualize Monroe County and the City of Rochester’s ARPA spending by policy category, the five building blocks of inclusive recovery, and RACF’s investment priorities. By tracking recovery funding expenditures, this dashboard allows us to monitor public spending by the categories most critical in supporting an inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
